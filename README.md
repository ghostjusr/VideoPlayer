# VideoPlayer - very WIP
VideoPlayer is a fabric mod that allows playing videos by setting command blocks that edit text displays.
Still very WIP

# Dependencies
Requires Fabric API and CBSet.

# Simple usage
First, get an mp4 file and place it in the .minecraft/videos folder. If it does not already exist, create one.
Use !setup [<coords>] [<direction>] to setup the command blocks and use !play <filename> to play a video.
**This mod requires OP (Or at least /fill permissions) to work.

# Commands
[comment]: !setup [-b] [<coords>] [<direction>] [<height>] [<offset>] - Set up the command blocks
